## sends all commits in a range for review."all the commits on the current branch that you haven't pushed yet"
arc diff   ## This prompts you to update revision information.
## Can specify a different commit range instead by running:
arc diff <commit>

## workflows arc supports are:
## Works in Git if you develop in feature branches. Does a merge or squash-merge from your feature branch into some master branch, provides a detailed commit message, pushes master, and then deletes your branch.
arc land
## Works in Git if you can't use arc land. Amends HEAD with a detailed commit message.
arc amend
## Works anywhere, closes a revision from the CLI without going through the web UI.
arc close-revision

##arc land, arc amend will implicitly run arc close-revision
